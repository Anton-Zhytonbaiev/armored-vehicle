          Invisibility in the flow of traffic, ability to mimic the environment is not the only advantage of hidden capsule armoring technology. The steel capsule under the carâ€™s casing from Zodiac Engineering will protect not only from bullets and grenades, but also in road accidents. The reinforced suspension and the armored module inside serve as a solid skeleton of the entire vehicle structure, giving it additional rigidity and strength.
